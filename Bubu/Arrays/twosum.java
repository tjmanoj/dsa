/*
Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.
1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.
2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.
Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.

/*
 In this approach, we will first sort the array and will try to choose the numbers in a greedy way.
We will keep a left pointer at the first index and a right pointer at the last index. Now until left < right, we will check the sum of arr[left] and arr[right]. Now if the sum < target, we need bigger numbers and so we will increment the left pointer. But if sum > target, we need to consider lesser numbers and so we will decrement the right pointer. 
If sum == target we will return either “YES” or the indices as per the question.
But if the left crosses the right pointer, we will return “NO” or {-1, -1}.
